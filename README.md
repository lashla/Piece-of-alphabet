# Piece-of-alphabet
Write a program that reads a string and output true only when the letters of this string form a substring of the ordered English alphabet, for example, "abc", "xy", "pqrst".

Otherwise, it should print out false.

Note: string can consist of a single character. Assume an empty string as an alphabet substring.
